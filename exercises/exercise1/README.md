# Exercise 1

- Go through the html and css file and understand what the classes and elements do.
- Make modifications to the css classes or the markup (remove classes, add classes, change class properties, etc.) and see what happens.
- Create classes to color the boxes (eg.: create a "green" class what will make the background color of an element green).
- Create additional layout classes (like "two-in-a-row") to display 5,6...12 elements in a row.
- Play around with the new layout classes. Combine eg. two-in-a-row with four-in-a-row elements and see what happens.
